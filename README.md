# For whom is alunari made for?

alunari is a Python package for Data science and Machine learning, designed to aid researchers and engineers to meet their goals with small effort.

# What is the meaning of 'alunari'?

The root of the name alunari is 'luna' which means 'the moon' in latin, visually represented as the crescent moon in the logo itself to portrait the main idea of alunari - making complex programming done in the background (the dark, not visible side of the moon), while the outcome that actually matters is highlighted as the crescent itself (visible side of the moon that defines it's presence). 

# Is alunari free to use?

alunari is completely free of charge for both personal and commercial use, but only under the conditions stated in the license. Developing such a complex module isnâ€™t easy and takes a lot of time and knowledge in several fields of science such as statistics, programming and domain knowledge, so any donation at https://patreon.com/dkundih or https://www.buymeacoffee.com/dkundih in order to keep alunari free is more than welcome.
